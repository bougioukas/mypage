## About me

I am a research methodologist and data analyst specializing in evidence synthesis, an applied statistician, and an independent data visualization enthusiast based in Greece.
Driven by a profound interest in meta-research within the medical domain, social sciences, and public health, I am deeply engaged in exploring avenues to enhance the integrity, rigor, and reproducibility of data analysis and visualization. Recently, I have also begun exploring the applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare and evidence synthesis tasks, aiming to optimize decision-making processes and research outcomes.

I have extensive experience teaching Statistics and leading R practical sessions as an Adjunct Lecturer at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Complementing my teaching role, I authored the free, online version of the textbook ["Practical Statistics in Medicine with R"](https://practical-stats-med-r.netlify.app/). 
Over the years, I've contributed to the R community by developing three open source R packages in collaborative and independently: ["ccaR", "amstar2Vis", "musicolor"](/packages.qmd).
Additionally, I maintain the first database that contains a list of a large number of healthcare overviews of reviews (["OMG-database"](https://overviews-database.netlify.app/)), along with a website, ["RECREATING DATA VISUALIZATIONS IN R"](https://bougioukas.github.io/storytelling/), where I recreate published data visualizations sourced from scholarly articles, websites, or media sources.


 

`r fa("pen-to-square", fill = "#1DC5CE")` **Academic publications**

I have contributed to [more than 40 peer-reviewed research papers](/publications.qmd) published in high-impact academic journals including: *BMJ-British Medical Journal*, *Research Synthesis Methods*, *Journal of Clinical Epidemiology*, *Current Problems in Cardiology*, *Metabolism*,*Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology*, *Journal of Dentistry*, and *PLoS Computational Biology*.
