## About me

I am a research methodologist with a focus on evidence synthesis, a biostatistician, and an independent data visualization enthusiast based in Greece.
Driven by a profound interest in meta-research within the medical domain, I am deeply engaged in exploring avenues to enhance the integrity, rigor and reproducibility of medical data analysis and visualization.


I am the author of the online, free textbook [Practical Statistics in Medicine with R](https://practical-stats-med-r.netlify.app/) and I have developed three R packages in collaborative and independently: [`ccaR`](https://github.com/thdiakon/ccaR), [`amstar2Vis`](https://github.com/bougioukas/amstar2Vis),[`musicolor`](https://github.com/bougioukas/musicolor) (all available open source at [github](https://github.com/bougioukas/)).

Additionally, I maintain the first database that contains a list of a large number of healthcare overviews of reviews ([OMG-database](https://overviews-database.netlify.app/)), along with a website, [
STORYTELLING WITH R GRAPHS AND ChatGPT](https://bougioukas.github.io/storytelling/), where I recreate published figures sourced from scholarly articles, websites, or media sources.

 

`r fa("pen-to-square", fill = "#1DC5CE")` **Academic publications**

I have contributed to more than 30 peer-reviewed research papers published in high-impact academic journals including: *BMJ-British Medical Journal*, *Current Problems in Cardiology*, *Metabolism*, *Research Synthesis Methods*, *Journal of Clinical Epidemiology*, *Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology*, *Journal of Dentistry*, and *PLoS Computational Biology*.
