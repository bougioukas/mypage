    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nSystematic reviews (SRs) have an important role in the healthcare decision-making practice. Assessing the overall confidence in the results of SRs using quality assessment tools, such as “A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2” (AMSTAR 2), is crucial since not all SRs are conducted using the most rigorous methods. In this article, we introduce a free, open-source R package called “amstar2Vis” https://github.com/bougioukas/amstar2Vis that provides easy-to-use functions for presenting the critical appraisal of SRs, based on the items of AMSTAR 2 checklist. An illustrative example is outlined, describing the steps involved in creating a detailed table with the item ratings and the overall confidence ratings, generating a stacked bar plot that shows the distribution of ratings as percentages of SRs for each AMSTAR 2 item, and creating a “ggplot2” graph that shows the distribution of overall confidence ratings (“Critically Low,” “Low,” “Moderate,” or “High”). We expect “amstar2Vis” to be useful for overview authors and methodologists who assess the quality of SRs with AMSTAR 2 checklist and facilitate the production of pertinent publication-ready tables and figures. Future research and applications could further investigate the functionality or potential improvements of our package."
