    "text": "Abstract\nSystematic reviews (SRs) have an important role in the healthcare decision-making practice. Assessing the overall confidence in the results of SRs using quality assessment tools, such as “A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2” (AMSTAR 2), is crucial since not all SRs are conducted using the most rigorous methods. In this article, we introduce a free, open-source R package called “amstar2Vis” https://github.com/bougioukas/amstar2Vis that provides easy-to-use functions for presenting the critical appraisal of SRs, based on the items of AMSTAR 2 checklist. An illustrative example is outlined, describing the steps involved in creating a detailed table with the item ratings and the overall confidence ratings, generating a stacked bar plot that shows the distribution of ratings as percentages of SRs for each AMSTAR 2 item, and creating a “ggplot2” graph that shows the distribution of overall confidence ratings (“Critically Low,” “Low,” “Moderate,” or “High”). We expect “amstar2Vis” to be useful for overview authors and methodologists who assess the quality of SRs with AMSTAR 2 checklist and facilitate the production of pertinent publication-ready tables and figures. Future research and applications could further investigate the functionality or potential improvements of our package."

    "text": "A normal Q-Q plot is a visualization for assessing whether a given sample is consistent with a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It is constructed by plotting the theoretical quantiles of a standard normal distribution on the horizontal axis against the sample quantiles (i.e., the ordered values of the dataset) on the vertical axis.\n\nSample quantiles\nLet Y be a random variable with \\(n\\) observations \\(y_1, y_2,..., y_n\\). First, we sort the observations from smallest to largest: \\(y_{(1)} \\leq y_{(2)} \\leq \\cdots \\leq y_{(n)}\\). Then, for each ordered value \\(y_{(i)}\\) (sample quantile), we assign a cumulative probability—referred to as plotting position—according to Hazen’s formula \\(P_i = \\frac{i-0.5}{n}\\), where \\(i = 1, 2, ..., n\\) (Table 1). This convention, originally proposed by Hazen (1914) and later discussed by Cunnane (1978), is often applied for sufficiently large sample sizes (e.g. n &gt; 10).\n\n\n\nTable 1: Sample quantiles and plotting positions for \\(n&gt;10\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample quantile  \\(y_{(i)}\\)\nPlotting position  \\(P_i = \\frac{i-0.5}{n}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(y_{(1)}\\)\n\\(\\frac{0.5}{n}\\)\n\n\n\\(y_{(2)}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1.5}{n}\\)\n\n\n\\(y_{(3)}\\)\n\\(\\frac{2.5}{n}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n\\(y_{(n)}\\)\n\\(\\frac{n-0.5}{n}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n​\nExample: Twenty 9-year-old children with age-appropriate development completed a visual matching task on a computer.

As an example, for the first (\\(i=1\\)) plotting position, we have \\(P_1 = 0.025\\). Therefore: \\(P(Z &lt; z_1) = 0.025 \\Rightarrow z_1 = \\Phi^{-1}(0.025) \\approx -1.96\\) (Table 4). This means that 2.5% of the standard normal distribution falls below \\(z_1 = -1.96\\).\n\n\n\nTable 4: Plotting positions and theoretical quantiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting position  \\(P_i\\)\nTheoretical quantile  \\(z_i = \\Phi^{-1}(P_i)\\)\n\n\n\n\n0.025\n-1.96\n\n\n0.075\n-1.44\n\n\n0.125\n-1.15\n\n\n0.175\n-0.93\n\n\n0.225\n-0.76\n\n\n0.275\n-0.60\n\n\n0.325\n-0.45\n\n\n0.375\n-0.32\n\n\n0.425\n-0.19\n\n\n0.475\n-0.06\n\n\n0.525\n0.06\n\n\n0.575\n0.19\n\n\n0.625\n0.32\n\n\n0.675\n0.45\n\n\n0.725\n0.60\n\n\n0.775\n0.76\n\n\n0.825\n0.93\n\n\n0.875\n1.15\n\n\n0.925\n1.44\n\n\n0.975\n1.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R\nThe theoretical quantiles can be calculated using the qnorm() function:\n\nz_i &lt;- qnorm(Pi)\nz_i\n\n [1] -1.95996398 -1.43953147 -1.15034938 -0.93458929 -0.75541503 -0.59776013\n [7] -0.45376219 -0.31863936 -0.18911843 -0.06270678  0.06270678  0.18911843\n[13]  0.31863936  0.45376219  0.59776013  0.75541503  0.93458929  1.15034938\n[19]  1.43953147  1.95996398\n\n\n\n\nThe Q-Q plot\nThe last step is to generate the normal Q-Q plot by plotting the theoretical quantiles (\\(z_i\\)) on the x-axis against the sample quantiles (\\(y_{(i)}\\)) on the y-axis using the values from Table 5.\n\n\n\nTable 5: Theoretical quantiles and sample quantiles for RT data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheoretical quantile  \\(z_i\\)\nSample quantile  \\(y_{(i)}\\)\n\n\n\n\n-1.96\n837\n\n\n-1.44\n1236\n\n\n-1.15\n1367\n\n\n-0.93\n1369\n\n\n-0.76\n1400\n\n\n-0.60\n1415\n\n\n-0.45\n1500\n\n\n-0.32\n1584\n\n\n-0.19\n1687\n\n\n-0.06\n1698\n\n\n0.06\n1725\n\n\n0.19\n1843\n\n\n0.32\n1908\n\n\n0.45\n1938\n\n\n0.60\n2265\n\n\n0.76\n2549\n\n\n0.93\n2953\n\n\n1.15\n3696\n\n\n1.44\n4417\n\n\n1.96\n5179\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make QQ plot\nplot(z_i, y_sorted,\n     xlab = \"Theoretical Quantiles\", \n     ylab = \"Sample Quantiles\", \n     main = \"Normal Q-Q Plot\",\n     pch = 1, col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a reference line (Quartile Method)\nThe Quartile Method is a robust technique for defining a reference line on a Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot. The line passes through the first quartile (\\(Q_1\\)) and third quartile (\\(Q_3\\)) of both the theoretical and sample distributions.\nThe reference line is \\(y = b_o + b_1 z\\), where the slope and intercept are calculated as:\n\\(b_1 = \\frac{y_{0.75} - y_{0.25}}{z_{0.75} - z_{0.25}}\\)\n\\(b_0 = y_{0.25} - b_1 \\, z_{0.25}\\)\nHere, \\(z_{0.25}\\) and \\(z_{0.75}\\) are the first and third quartiles of the theoretical standard normal distribution, while \\(y_{0.25}\\) and \\(y_{0.75}\\) are the corresponding quartiles of the sample.\n​\nIn R\n\n# Compute quartiles\nz25 &lt;- qnorm(0.25)\nz75 &lt;- qnorm(0.75)\ny25 &lt;- quantile(y, 0.25)\ny75&lt;- quantile(y, 0.75)\n\n# Compute line parameters\nb1 &lt;- (y75 - y25) / (z75 - z25)\nb0 &lt;- y25 - b1 * z25\n\n​\n\n# Make QQ plot\nplot(z_i, y_sorted,\n     xlab = \"Theoretical Quantiles\", \n     ylab = \"Sample Quantiles\", \n     main = \"Normal Q-Q Plot\",\n     pch = 1, col = \"black\")\n\n# Add the quartile-based line\nabline(b0, b1, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Q–Q plot shows clear deviations from the reference line, particularly in the upper tail, indicating that the data are not normally distributed and exhibit positive skewness. This conclusion is further supported by the histogram and boxplot, which display an asymmetric distribution of reaction times, with a long right tail and two outliers.\n\nlayout(mat = matrix(c(1,2), ncol = 1), heights = c(2, 8))\n\n# Top: horizontal boxplot\npar(mar = c(0, 4, 1, 2))\nboxplot(y, horizontal = TRUE, axes = FALSE, \n        col = \"lightgray\", outline = TRUE)\n\n# Bottom: histogram\npar(mar = c(5, 4, 0, 2))\nhist(y, main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n​\nThe normal Q–Q plot can be generated using the built-in R functions qqnorm() and qqline().\n\nqqnorm(y)\nqqline(y, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add a box‑plot for the sample quantiles to the right-side of the Q–Q plot as follows:\n\n# Set up the plotting layout: 2 columns, first column wider\nlayout(matrix(c(1, 2), nrow = 1), widths = c(3, 0.6))\n\n# Set margins for both plots\npar(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 1))\n\n# Create Q-Q plot\nqqnorm(y)\nqqline(y, col = \"red\")\n\n# Set margins for boxplot (reduce left margin)\npar(mar = c(5, 1, 4, 2))\n\n# Create boxplot on the right\nboxplot(y, yaxt = \"n\", frame = FALSE, ylim = range(y))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCunnane, C. 1978. “Unbiased Plotting Positions — a Review.” Journal of Hydrology 37 (3): 205–22. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(78)90017-3.\n\n\nHazen, A. 1914. “Storage to Be Provided in Impounding Reservoirs for Municipal Water Supply.” Trans.
